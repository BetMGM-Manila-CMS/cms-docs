> Heads up everyone - we have not fully escaped cross-sell promos. Will chat further on our call Thursday, but FYI you may see tasks to add carousels for:

> BTL SOCCER PICK A FOOTBALL

> BTL NHL PICK A PUCK

> Yes, these say BTL. No, they are not BTL, they are public and should have been assigned to our team but since it's already last minute - CRM CMS team will be handling these builds, but we will be handling carousels on casino sites.

> Tagging EveryoneÂ so US & Manila teams are aware that Gaming CMS should not be building/testing/scheduling these beyond **just carousels**. Lmk if you have any questions, thank you
