Hello everyone,

Today, I have just received confirmation from the Marketing  Team to direct all future Jackpot(s) (Slots) Announcement to the following SmartLinks:

Changed:
BetMGM:

* MI: !!M2.CasinoHome/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=901 > [https://www.mi.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=901](\[https://www.mi.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=901)
* NJ: !!M2.CasinoHome/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=501 > [https://www.nj.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=501](https://www.nj.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=501)

      * Sitecore Direct Link: `https\://cms-us.prod.env.works/sitecore/DirectLink.aspx?fo={E9E3B23D-5EC9-4B0D-9699-AF214CFDFCF4}\&la=`
* PA: !!M2.CasinoHome/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=701 > [https://www.pa.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=701](\[https://www.pa.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=701)
* WV: !!M2.CasinoHome/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=801 > [https://www.wv.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=801](https://www.wv.betmgm.com/en/casino/c/jackpots?jackpotgroupId=801)

**How To Tell:**
If you are building, reviewing, or site-checking and notice that under the Jackpot(s) (Slots) > Featured Casino Lobby Section, the Jackpot Tiles feature is enabled for The Big Series or The Big One, Colossal Cash:

Click on the View Games > CTA and you will be directed to one of the SmartLinks mentioned above:

However, with the recent increase of Requests to also schedule Video Banners on there, the Publishing > Unpublish date will also take down the Jackpot Tiles feature, so to confirm that the Jackpot Tiles feature was once enabled before for the above, visit Jackpot(s) (Slots) > Featured, LMTCategory > instantCasino, then scroll almost all the way down and you will see the following settings:

If you are building, reviewing, or site-checking and notice that under the Jackpot(s) (Slots) > Featured Casino Lobby Section, the Icon (theme-trending), HeaderTitle (For The Biggest Wins), and Jackpot Tiles features are not displaying for the above, to display them again, visit Jackpot(s) (Slots) > Featured, LMTCategory > instantCasino, then Clear both the:

* GameVideos
  * ImageOrVideoUrl
  * ImageThumbnail
  * LaunchUrl > Url
* Publishing
  * Optional
    * Publish date
  * Must
    * Unpublish date

If it has been after a while since you have tried, but still cannot display them again, please do not hesitate and feel free to let me know, so that we can troubleshoot together.

Reason:

This is because whenever there is a Jackpot(s) (Slots) Announcement Request, the Marketing Team only meant for The Big Series or The Big One, Colossal Cash for in-house games, not for All Jackpot(s) (Slots), but we have been directing to All Jackpot(s) (Slots), since the Jackpot Tiles feature is a recently new addition where the Casino Lobby Team sorted all The Big Series or The Big One Colossal Cash for in-house games under one (1) dedicated Casino Lobby Section, whereas usually, they are mixed with other non-eligible games under the Jackpot(s) (Slots) > Featured and All Jackpot Slots Casino Lobby Sections.
