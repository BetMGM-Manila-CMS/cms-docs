Hi all,

Hope all is well. I wanted to forward along this chain as a reminder. We’ve run into this problem in the past and want to make sure everyone is aware that when both Ops & CMS are both needed for a promotion, **CMS should not push anything live/make changes to PAT/EDS without having what we need from Ops. **This problem is most common when there is a change request/extension of a promotion. In the past, we’ve seen the same few issues:

* Stakeholder does not add Ops in CHR
* Stakeholder does not alert Ops of CHR nor add it to the In-Progress CHR chat

In this instance, the stakeholder included Ops on the CHR, but did not specifically alert anyone from the Ops team. Mike added a task for them and while that should be enough, we know at this point to over-communicate in situations like this.

Let’s continue to communicate and work together with Ops to make sure these tasks are done correctly. When extending/shorting promotions that require PAT/EDS, please be sure that Ops is aware and works on their tasks before we do. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out.

Thank you!
