> EveryoneÂ just a note when building tiered promos - I know we've done many like this in the past, but when naming the MPP URL, let's stay away from adding 'high core,' 'low core,' 'VIP core' etc in the link. Most of the time, users won't see it but on the off chance someone is on desktop and paying attention to where the link is directing them, the target group info shouldn't be customer-facing.

> For example: [https://www.mi.betmgm.com/en/mobileportal/promotions/casino/high-core-roar-to-riches-casino-challenge](https://www.mi.betmgm.com/en/mobileportal/promotions/casino/high-core-roar-to-riches-casino-challenge)

> We don't want that in the URL, so we can change it to a number like 1 or pretty much whatever you want that doesn't highlight the segmentation group.

> Aldous & team are currently working on the Roar to Riches tickets, but just a note going forward when starting new tiered promotions. Thanks!
