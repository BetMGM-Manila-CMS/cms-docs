As per Vivian, 

> I have been reverting "and" to "&" instead, because the Terms and Conditions, Copy, and Creative refer to the Promotion with "&", so I wanted to exactly match for easier player recognition.

> For example:

1. Bet And Get -> Bet & Get
2. Play And Earn -> Play & Earn
3. Spin And Win -> Spin & Win

> At the moment, I can only recently recall this past INC in which special characters do not render as inputted on iOS Mobile App, but it has been Closed and Resolved: [https://entain.service-now.com/esc?id=my\_ticket\&table=incident\&sys\_id=d8b94df4870bc610984d8…](https://entain.service-now.com/esc?id=my_ticket\&table=incident\&sys_id=d8b94df4870bc610984d8667cebb358a\&view=ess)

> Regarding any other past issue, I think "&" has been fine, since I have been reverting for a while now and have not noticed any issue. In addition, I recall Sports has been using "&" as well.

> In my opinion, "&" does not stylistically look as good on PartyCasino and Wheel of Fortune Casino Carousels, so I would then replace "&" with "AND" instead. In addition, most of the times, the H1 and H2 are not referring to a specific Promotion anyways.

> I hope this helps! So let us try the above, and continue to site-check, but if we notice anything off, please do not hesitate and feel free to share, so that we can immediately revert to replacing "&" with "and" instead. Thank you!

Here's the TL;DR:

* Use "&" when the title refers to an official Promotion name (to match Terms & Conditions, Copy, and Creative).
* Use "And" when it's purely stylistic, especially on PartyCasino or WoF carousels where "&" doesn't look as good.
* Previous iOS issues with rendering special characters have been resolved, and "&" has generally been safe to use.
* Continue site-checking, and switch back to "And" if we encounter any issues.
