To avoid any confusion on when and how to use the OLG line, please refer to the guide below. We’ve also attached a more detailed version with screenshots for easier reference.

**Important:** These guidelines apply only if the OLG line is present in the copy. If there’s no OLG line, you may proceed without adding anything.

If the OLG line is present:

**FOR CASINO**

**Shared promotion – NJ only**

* Add the OLG line to all components:
  * Shared PAT
  * Shared Rest ID
  * Individual MPPs

**Shared promotion – all states (NJ, WV, MI, PA)**

* Retain the OLG line only in:
  * Shared PAT
  * Shared Rest ID
  * MPP NJ
* Remove the OLG line from:
  * MPP WV
  * MPP MI
  * MPP PA

** **

**FOR SPORTS**

* All states / multiple states:
  * Add “For NJ only:” before the OLG line.
* NJ only:
  * The OLG line can be used as is.
