> Hey Everyone!

> Sorry for the delay on this I was waiting for confirmations but just wanted to now confirm that the 500x500 story sizes will no longer be used on borgata and we will be using the 65x65 size in replace of the 500x500. I know Vivian has been working on this and it seems that the other sizes just weren't fitting correctly? But if you have any questions please reach out to Vivian and she will be able to assist!

> noted on this! will the toaster creatives do for the story sizes?

> Yes! In the borgata asset packs in the design requests for toaster, it is now "Story-Toaster (65x65)"
