> Hi team,

> Just noticed yesterday that there were some issues with the promotions.We’ve been taking down the promotions until the US team can resolve the issue, which causes the promotions to remain unpublished for a longer period.
> To streamline this, I had a discussion with Alyssa last night, and we proposed reverting to our approach from 2021 and 2022 for handling similar situations.
> So, if the EDS or OPT IN ID is not working, here’s what we’ll do:

1. Unpublish the promotions – including carousels and any other live content that provides user access to the page.
2. Raise the issue in the OPS & CMS group chat. Don, Ralph, and Aman will add you if you need to raise an issue.
3. Be sure to include the following:

* A description of the issue
  * The promo and the PAT ID
  * A screenshot
* Tag Alex Oppenheimer, Anu Deep Lakkavaram, and Simran Yadav.

> OPS will then check this when they log in, with the earliest being at 3 PM Manila time.We can then reset things once they provide a new ID or resolve the existing issue on their end.\This process will provide visibility not only to our US counterparts but also to all other stakeholders involved.It will also help ensure quicker resolution and minimize the time a promotion stays unpublished.

> If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to reach out.

> Thank you!
