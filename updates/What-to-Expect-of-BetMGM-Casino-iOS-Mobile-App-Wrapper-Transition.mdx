Hello everyone,

On November 10th, BetMGM Casino iOS Mobile App > West Virginia is the first to transition to Wrapper

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1765762575/updates/mc-wv-wrapper-transition/MCWVWrapperTransition_image1_k0aev8.png)

So what can we expect of this and future Wrapper transitions?
First, I would like to best describe the Wrapper transition in my own words as I come to better understand it as "a mirror of Mobile Web on Mobile App."

Since by standard, Mobile Web is usually accommodated and built for, anything specific to iOS Mobile App and ODR now no longer need to be accommodated and built for on BetMGM WV, including the following:

1. ODR Burger Menu
2. ODR Casino Lobby Tab Icon
3. ODR Banner
4. ODR Casino Lobby Section HeaderTitle or Subtitle
5. ODR Video Banner
6. ODR Embedded Banner
7. ODR Footer Menu

Therefore, if you are able to access the BetMGM Casino iOS Mobile App and state-switch to West Virigina, then what you are observing is "a mirror of BetMGM WV Mobile Web", because based on the back-end of BetMGM Casino iOS Mobile App > West Virginia:

1. ODR Burger Menu should list Live Dealer, All Games, Slots, and Promotions
   * But actually lists Jackpots, Live Dealer, Slots, and Promotions instead per the back-end of BetMGM WV Web Burger Menu
2. ODR Casino Lobby Tab Icons should display similar to BetMGM Casino iOS Mobile App > Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ontario
   * But actually somewhat do not instead, like on BetMGM WV Web
     * Most likely as a result of an adverse effect of a recent Product rollout that I noticed since yesterday
3. ODR Banner order should publicly display the "Grab a $5 Casino Bonus / WHEN YOU WAGER $50" for Crazy Time before the "Hit a Share of $25K / CLIMB THE LIVE DEALER LEADERBOARD" for Live Dealer
   * But actually publicly displays the "Hit a Share of $25K / CLIMB THE LIVE DEALER LEADERBOARD" for Live Dealer before the "Grab a $5 Casino Bonus / WHEN YOU WAGER $50" for Crazy Time instead per the back-end of the BetMGM WV Optimized Teaser order
4. ODR Casino Lobby Section HeaderTitles or Subtitles should display only on Home > Featured, Jackpots > Featured, New Games > Hottest New Releases, and Table Games > Featured
   * But actually display on so much more Casino Lobby Sections instead per the back-end of the BetMGM WV Web Casino Lobby Section
5. ODR Video Banner for Hollywood Hits > Featured does not exist
   * But actually displays The Wizard of Oz Munchkinland Video Banner per the back-end of BetMGM WV Web
6. ODR Embedded Banner of "GO FOR GOLD / PLAY GOLD NUDGE NOW! / EXCLUSIVELY AT BETMGM" for Gold Nudge should display
   * But actually does not, since Embedded Banner has always been an ODR exclusive feature
     * Rob Passerino, Brandon Switzer, and Daniel Kaplan if you would like for Embedded Banner to also be a feature for Web, please request of and discuss with Product
       * Otherwise and in the meantime, please do not submit a Request for any BetMGM WV ODR Embedded Banner, since they will not display
         * Mike David, please reject, do not convert and assign, and/or delete any future Request for BetMGM WV ODR Embedded Banner
7. ODR Footer Menu shows no noticeable difference, since it has always listed Sports, Casino, Promotions then Rewards, and Account for as long as I can remember
   * But we just do not need to especially edit and/or update it anymore
8. Bonuses
   * Casino Lobby Section Icons were never displaying, because I could never figure-out how to configure them
     * But they are now displaying, because I configured them only on BetMGM WV Web
   * Casino Lobby Section Informational ( i ) were never displaying, because I did not get the chance to try and configure them
     * But they are now displaying, because I configured them only on BetMGM WV Web
   * Casino Lobby Section Game Tile Badges updated only on BetMGM WV Web by Ruben with top-left-cornering, translucent background color, white text color, and standard case text style at the request of Product are displaying
     * But BetMGM Casino iOS Mobile App > Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ontario did not transition to Wrapper yet, so they are still displaying with almost top-left-cornering, gold background color, black text color, and standard case text style as well
   * Casino Lobby Section Parallaxes were never displaying, because I did not get the chance to try and configure them
     * But they are now displaying, because I configured them only on BetMGM WV Web
   * Casino Lobby Tab SEO Texts were never displaying, because we did not try to configure them, since search engines cannot crawl
     * But they are now displaying, because we configured them only on BetMGM WV Web, since search engines can crawl

Please note that the above is not an exhaustive list, but a list of features that I were able to notice and point-out during the time of drafting this email.

In conclusion and addition to what Michael announced, we save time by no longer doing double the work by accommodating and building anything specific to iOS Mobile App and ODR, but only on BetMGM WV for now, so looking forward to future Wrapper transitions!

This is all I have to share at the moment that I have discovered regarding this topic, but if I have any additional update to share, then I will follow-up via email by Replying All.

If you have any question and/or concern at all, please do not hesitate and feel free to let me know.
Sorry that I did not draft and send this email sooner, but thank you for your attention, understanding, assistance, and time!


Kind regards,

Vivian
