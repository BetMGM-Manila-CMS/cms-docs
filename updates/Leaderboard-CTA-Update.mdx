#### For Leaderboard Promotions

> [https://betmgm.my.workfront.com/project/666c903200566207b4679527799dbd81/updates](https://betmgm.my.workfront.com/project/666c903200566207b4679527799dbd81/updates) Please make sure we are all going forward with 'See Rankings' and linking to /lb/PAT ID for all leaderboard promotions. Some of these have those updates made while others don't and we want to be the same across the board so please update if you haven't already (for this and all future LBs)

#### For Landing Pages

> Hey all quick thing - 

> Going forward, we are going to stay away from using 'REGISTER' or 'SIGN UP NOW' and instead stick with 'SIGN UP' On our end, this will mostly apply to landing pages - brand & acq is going to get us a list of active LPs at some point so we can make those changes (it's not a ton), but going forward when creating new LPs, even if the copy provided says 'REGISTER,' let's replace that CTA with 'SIGN UP.' Eventually all will have that in the request, but for tickets that were already briefed in, we can use 'SIGN UP.' This mostly applies to the Manila team and me

In any instance, REGISTER means to Register for the Tournament and not Register for an account especially because sometimes if you Pre-register for headliner Tournaments, you qualify for Prizes, as referred to in How To Participate the CTA should not be changed to 'SIGN UP'
