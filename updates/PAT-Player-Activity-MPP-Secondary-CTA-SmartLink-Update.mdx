> Hello everyone,

> For PAT Player Activity, the MPP secondary CTA has always been See My Progress for BetMGM or SEE MY PROGRESS for all other labels except BetMGM, directing to !!M2.Promo/offers/grouped?filter=cp, so that players are directed to the Filtered, Casino PAT Promotions Hub Page to search for the specific PAT Player Activity, Promotions Hub Tile.

\--

> However, we should optimize our user journey with less steps, so for single Promotional Period, PAT Player Activity, the Parent Final PAT ID will not reproduce Children Final PAT IDs, since the promotion will start and end just once, the MPP secondary CTA should direct to !!M2.Promo/pa/PAT ID #, but with the PAT ID # replaced with the actual number instead, for example, 123456 for !!M2.Promo/pa/123456, so that players are immediately directed to the PAT Player Activity Page, specifically the My Progress Tab in which the URL will automatically prepopulate and end with …/promo/pa/PAT ID #/myprogress if the players have successfully opted-in, or specifically the Overview Tab in which the URL will automatically prepopulate and end with …/promo/pa/PAT ID #/overview if the players have not successfully opted-in yet.

> **The key to determining which direction to use is by reviewing the How It Works and/or Terms and Conditions, but if you incorrectly directed to the Final PAT Player Activity Page for multiple Promotional Days or Weeks, Promotional Period, PAT Player Activity, promotion instead, then no worries, since that will attempt to direct to the Final PAT Player Activity Page, but will fail, since only the Child PAT Player Activity Page is available then, and redirect back to the Home, Promotions Hub Page, which is another reason why site-checking is important.**

> Please do not hesitate and feel free to let me know if you have any question and/or concern at all.

> Thank you as always for your attention, understanding, assistance, and time.

> Kind regards,
