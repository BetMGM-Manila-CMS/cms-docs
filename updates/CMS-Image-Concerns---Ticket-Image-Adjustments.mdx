Hello Everyone,

Good day.

Here is the summary of our meeting earlier:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1770024976/updates/design-request-adjustments/designrequestadjustmentsImage1_oeirao.png)

Make sure to check who created the MOCK Designs, if Manila made the ticket mock, we can ask in GC teams for edits, for US team we need to request for CHRs.

Inform subleads and tagged Mike David for image adjustments for Design team.

Let me know if you have any questions.


Thank you.
