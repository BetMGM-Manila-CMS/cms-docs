Hello everyone,

In light of:

1. Initial P16 - INC2106530: Casino Users Unable to Spin Wizard of Oz Daily Picks Promo Tool
2. p3 / op\_Trinity7232 / VIP HOSTED (Y) - "RUSH" Wizard of Oz Daily Picks promo tool (Borgata NJ, PA) - Wizard of Oz promotion link leading to different game/promotion
   I would like to go-over Thunderbite Daily Picks Engagement Tool.

Build Template:

Creative:

MPP:
Final URL:

Optimized Teaser or Story:
ODR Banner:
Promotions Hub Static Tile:

Rest ID, Reward Template + ITO:
If the reward includes Bonus Spins and BetMGM or Borgata Online NJ is included with the other states in single label Projects, please do not forget to build a Rest ID, Bonus Spins - Fixed No Deposit No Wager to accommodate, and if the Terms and Conditions are the exact same, then no need to specifically add another ITO again to it as well.

**MPP:**

The following is the MPP Game Tile code we usually copy, paste, and replace or update from:

```html
<div class="game-tile d-flex flex-wrap flex-column text-center align-items-center">

  <a href="!!M2.CasinoHome/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks"><img class="pc-img" alt="The Wizard of Oz™ Daily Picks" src="-/media/3ED50DF26B25454EA123BCF017F1BDF3.ashx"></a>
  <a href="!!M2.CasinoHome/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks" class="btn btn-primary btn-block btn-lg"
    style="width: 200px; border-radius: 0;"><strong>Play Here</strong></a>
</div>
<br>
```

Please be careful to double-check the four (4) highlights and replace or update the values before publishing the Optimized Teaser or Story, ODR Banner, and Promotions Hub Static Tile that will be directing to the MPP, which houses the MPP Game Tile:

1. Game Tile Image direction after clicking or tapping
   * The direction may be provided as a Launch Game URL of [https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks](https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks), but we should use a Launch Game SmartLink instead by combining the beginning of !!M2.CasinoHome/launchng/ with the ending from the Launch Game URL, tbfree2playwozdailypicks for `!!M2.CasinoHome/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks`
2. Game Tile Image name
   * The featured game name from Copy
3. Game Tile Image source
   * If the Image is uploaded in the Workfront Project > Documents and can be downloaded, download it, upload it into the Creative folder, Copy Media Link, and paste it
4. Play Here CTA direction after clicking or tapping
   * The direction may be provided as a Launch Game URL of [https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks](https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks), but we should use a Launch Game SmartLink instead by combining the beginning of `!!M2.CasinoHome/launcng/` with the ending from the Launch Game URL, tbfree2playwozdailypicks for `!!M2.CasinoHome/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks`

Please do not forget to copy-and-paste the `<br>` part of the code as well, because although it is not as noticeable on desktop, since the How It Works is further left-aligned:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907449/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image1_twwqdj.png)

It is definitely noticeable on mobile when the How It Works is not as further left-aligned, and the MPP Game Tile will be immediately on top of How It Works otherwise, so in this case, `<br>` is part of the code, since there is adequate spacing between the MPP Game Tile and How It Works:

How to Quickly Double-check:

See if the MPP Game Tile Image is displaying the correct featured game.

Then on desktop, hover your mouse cursor over both the MPP Game Tile Image and Play Here CTA.

They should both match and direct to the Launch Game Final URL of the featured game as shown on the bottom left corner:

[https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks](https://casino.pa.betmgm.com/en/games/launchng/tbfree2playwozdailypicks)

MPP Game Tile Image Mouse Cursor Hover:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907730/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image3_bomynm.png)

Play Here CTA Mouse Cursor Hover:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907738/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image4_hxvigr.png)

Lastly, no need to include the Click Tiles Below To Play Eligible Games and additional MPP Game Tiles of both the featured and rewarded games, because the focus should only be on the featured game and upon winning, the featured game Claim Prize CTA will direct to the Promotions Hub Casino Swimlane where the Promotions Hub Rest ID, Reward Template Tile for the rewarded game will be.

Promotions Hub Static Tile:

This is what the Promotions Hub Static Tile should look like on the front-end:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907480/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image5_v6otgg.png)

This is what the Promotions Hub Static Tile should look like on the back-end:

Both EligibilityCriteriaInfo and Description can be blank, but please source the Title from either the Copy's PROMO HUB KEY TERMS > H1 or Copy's name of the featured game, so in this case, it is the latter:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907458/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image6_eqsaaf.png)

Please source the Copy's PROMO HUB KEY TERMS > Short Summary \[160 characters max] in KeyTermsAndConditions as well as Design's Promohub Tiles-800x360 in TeaserImage:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907462/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image7_ilmjsc.png)

Please ensure that Product > Casino is ticked, so that the Promotions Hub Static Tile displays on the Casino Swimlane:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907465/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image8_flgwhr.png)

Please include both the Play Here CTA as the PrimaryCTA and Learn More CTA as the MoreInfoCTA for convenience:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907468/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image9_ncwqvx.png)

Please Order the Promotions Hub Static Tile as 0, so that its position is prioritized on the Promotions Hub Casino Swimlane order, and label the Promotions Hub Static Tile as Free-To-Play Game:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907471/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image10_xzr5rg.png)

Please both schedule and reschedule the OfferValidity > OfferEndDate, not to be confused with Validity > ValidUpTo, with the same Publishing > Unpublish date, but a time of 4:59 instead for 11:59 PM EST:

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1745907474/updates/thunderbite-engagement-tool/thunderbite_image11_o617lz.png)

Please both schedule and reschedule accordingly:
