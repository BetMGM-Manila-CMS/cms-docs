> Hello everyone,

> For NJ PartyCasino and NJ partypoker, you may have already noticed that your test accounts share the same username, so you may receive emails from NJ partypoker, but with different Subjects for NJ PartyCasino and NJ partypoker, and you may receive Inboxes from NJ partypoker on NJ PartyCasino and from NJ PartyCasino on NJ partypoker.

> As a result, you may have already noticed that after I review NJ PartyCasino and NJ partypoker, Rest ID builds, I always replace the Urls from SmartLinks to Final URLs instead. This is because both NJ PartyCasino and NJ partypoker mostly do not share the same builds, so using SmartLinks will usually direct the Urls to broken, dead, or invalid pages instead.

> For example, building an ACQ LP on NJ partypoker and using its SmartLink in its Rest ID will direct to NJ PartyCasino’s version of the ACQ LP if its Rest ID is received on NJ PartyCasino, which will not be recognized as NJ PartyCasino does not already have its ACQ LP version built or need its version to be built, so the direction will be to a broken, dead, or invalid page instead, and building a MPP on NJ PartyCasino and using its SmartLink in its Rest ID will direct to NJ partypoker’s version of the MPP if its Rest ID is received on NJ partypoker, which will not be recognized as NJ partypoker does not already have its MPP version built or need its version to be built, so the direction will be to a broken, dead, or invalid page instead.

> Therefore, for new NJ PartyCasino and NJ partypoker Projects, please build Rest ID Urls with Final URLs instead of SmartLinks, and for old Projects with CHRs to revisit, please replace Rest ID Urls with Final URLs instead of SmartLinks, and update to both Toaster and Overlay V2 formats.

> Thank you as always for your attention, understanding, assistance, and time.
