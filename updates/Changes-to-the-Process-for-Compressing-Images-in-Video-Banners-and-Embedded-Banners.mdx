There is a new update regarding how image compression requests are handled for Video and Embedded Banner tickets. If the Design Team—whether the designers are from the US or Manila—is tagged on a Workfront ticket, the design request must go through a CHR, and the corresponding CMS ticket should be placed on hold. Otherwise, if the Design Team is not tagged in the Workfront ticket, we can directly request image compression through the CMS Design Concerns group chat.
