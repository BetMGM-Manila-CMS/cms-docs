# The Layout

First, we must build the layout for our Pinball Engagement tool.

<Admonition type="info" title="SiteCore Path">
  **Layout:**
  Content > Vanilla.Mobile > State/Brand > Promo > pinball

  It still does not have a designated folder yet.
</Admonition>

Duplicate any Layout, and rename it like in the existing layouts.

# Content

After duplicating the Layout click the dropdown go to `Content`, click the dropdown button and go to `gamesettings`.

Under `Parameters `you can change the `default_slider_value` into either High, Low or Medium if it is needed to be specified but if there is none you can leave this as is.

After that go to the `images` tab and navigate to the `Parameters` section. Usually there is no need to change any of the Images in this section except for the Multipliers which is highlighted below.
