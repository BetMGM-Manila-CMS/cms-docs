   * Image - Use the `40x40` images and place it in the same order as in the creatives folder order.
   * **Properties** - `3_40_40` is the default on all rows but this can change depending on the number of `40x40` image in the creatives folder. Most of the time only the first number will change which in this case is `3` it is the number of times the Image will show on the Claw Machine and the `40_40` is just the height and width of the image.
