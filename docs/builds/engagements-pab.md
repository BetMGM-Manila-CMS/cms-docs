# Pick A Box
Pick A Box is an Engagement tool for players to play and win prizes.

## The Layout
First, we must build the layout for our PAB Engagement tool.

:::info[SiteCore Path]
**Layout:**
Content > Vanilla.Mobile > State/Brand > Promo > Pick A Box
**CSS asset:**
Content > Vanilla.Mobile > State/Brand > Promo > PickaBox > PageAssets
:::

Duplicate any of the Layouts, and rename it like in the existing layouts.
You also need to create it's own CSS asset, just duplicate existing css and rename as such.
