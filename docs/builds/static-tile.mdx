The **Static Tile** contains Promohub Tile asset, Promo Title, Promo Description, and CTA/s. Static Tiles are can be found in this URL `https://promo.nj.betmgm.com/en/promo/offers` for BetMGM NJ. Each promo can have its own static tile as seen in the sample below. The highlighted static tile is for Piggy Blitz Bet & Get Promo.
