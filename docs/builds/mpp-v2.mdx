## Creating the MPP

When creating the MPP component you can either:

1. **Duplicate from template folder**
2. **Duplicate a sibling MPP** - You can also duplicate an existing MPP on the same state brand, aterwards rename the parent item to the provided name.

<Admonition type="note" title="Template">
  The [template](http://cms-us.prod.env.works/sitecore/DirectLink.aspx?fo={4D7657B8-1397-440D-88C2-33FA39BB366E}\&la=) is only avalable at BetMGM NJ. Make sure to copy it to the correct state.

## PageTitle

Select the parent and go to its Content Tab. Replace the `PageTitle` field in this field with `Promohub Key Terms H1`

This will be the name of the Tab when visiting the MPP page through the browser.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Publishing Components">
  Because on different applications some of the sections is not necessary, and these components can be set to Not Publish so that it wont show in the MPP when viewing through the browser.

## CTAs

The `CTAs` component contains 5 child components, each of the componetns are rendered as buttons in the MPP. depending on our use case we can just pulblish or unpublish what buttons we want to be shown.

![](/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-ctas.png)

Each component has their own set of fields, and some of it has already initial values that can be changed.

Here are the fields that can be updated to configure the CTA. Some fields are only present in some CTA,

1. **Text** - Update the text of the button. often times this does not need to be changed, but in rare occasion that there needs to be a CTA that is not available from the pre-made CTAs we can update the name of the CTA.
2. **button-type** - Indicates the color of the CTA. There are only 2 values for this: `primary` and `light`.
   * **primary** - can be used for single CTA MPP, but if there are multiple CTA, one CTA should have this value to indicate that its importance to the group of CTAs.
   * **light** - used for other CTA along with a *primary* CTA
3. **url** - contains the smartlink or url to be used when a user clicks the CTA.
4. **campaignId** - used for promotions that needs to `Opt In` we can place the value of the `PAT ID` or `EDS ID`.
5. **offer-type** - alongside `campaignId`, it indicated what type of promotion the CTA us being used for, the values can be used here is `promo` and `eds`.

Here are the pre-made CTAs and their fields:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="claimNow" label="Claim Now">

## Whitelabel MPP

When the MPP is idicated to be made in Whitelabel, most of the time this is because it should be available through multiple states .

To do this we will create a single MPP under the Whitelabel path and clone the MPP to the other states. Cloning will be done to all published components of the MPP, so no need to clone components that are not published. Here are the specific steps for cloning.

1. Open the `Clone Distribution` panel by right clicking the parent component.

   ![](/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-clone-parent.png)
2. Select all the states to clone the MPP and click OK.

   ![](/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-clone-panel-parent.png)
3. Go through each published subcomponent and when opening the `Clone Distribution` panel we can just click the `Clone All` checkbox as it will select all locations we have set to the parent when we have clones it. Then click OK.
