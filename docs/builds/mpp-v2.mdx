## Creating the MPP

When creating the MPP component you can either:

1. **Duplicate from template folder**

    <br />

    :::tip[Template]
    
    The [template](http://cms-us.prod.env.works/sitecore/DirectLink.aspx?fo={4D7657B8-1397-440D-88C2-33FA39BB366E}&la=) is only avalable at BetMGM NJ. Make sure to copy it to the correct state.

    :::

2. **Duplicate a sibling MPP**

    Or you can duplicate an existing MPP on the same state brand.

Afterwards rename the parent item to the provided name.

## PageTitle

Select the parent and go to its Content Tab. Replace the `PageTitle` field in this field with `Promohub Key Terms H1`

This will be the name of the Tab when visiting the MPP page through the browser.

<img src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-pagetitle.png" />

## Content

The Content child contains child of the components of the MPP. The components are separated individually.

:::tip[Publishing Components]

Because on different applications some of the sections is not necessary, and these components can be set to `Not Publish` so that it wont show in the MPP when viewing through the browser.

### Top Image

The Top image can be updated through ` Content > TopImage > Default` child.

Use the image `MPP-1080x486` and place its path on the `Image` field.

<img src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-topImage.png" />

### PageTitle

Compared to the `PageTitle` mentioned above this `PageTitle` will be shown on the MPP on the bottom of the image.

This is located on `Content > PageTitle > DefaultPageTitle`

1. Update the `Title` field with `Promohub Key Terms > H1`.
2. If there is a `Promotional Dates` indicated on your copy place it on the `epiry-date` field under `Parameters`

    <br />

   :::note[Date Format]
   
    Make sure that the date is on `MM/DD/YY` format, and add the time of `11:59 PM`.

### HowItWorks

Located on `Content > PromoDetails > DefaultHowItWorks`.

Use the content of the `How It Works` section from your copy and place it on the `Text` field. Just use the format for HTML ordered list.

```html title="How It Works Template"
<ol>
<li>Step 1</li>
<li>Step 2</li>
<li>Step 3</li>
</ol>
```

<img className="mt-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-hiw.png" />

### GameCarousel

The Game Carousel contains the tiles for games that players are eligible to play. Most of the time this is only used when building the MPP for Casino.

#### Slider

Clicking the `Content` tab for the Slider, here are some of the fields that can be changed to configure the slider:

1. **MaxItems** - is the maximum number of tiles to be displayed in the MPP. Set it to the number of eligible games mentioned for your ticket.
2. **slidesPerView** - number of tiles that is visible.
3. **slidesPerGroup** - number of tiles to be moved when sliding through the slider.

#### Updating a Game Tile

1. Click on an item under the `Slider`.
2. Get the game code from the [Game Smartlinks](./smartlinks#games) of the appropriate game.
3. Update the content of the `Text` field. You can refer to the format below.
```
${val:/sitecore/content/marketing/games/headline_games/{game code}.Content}
```

4. Save, Publish and Finalize.

:::note

Sometimes an error will occur when you try to save a game that is because the game is not in the path. This can happen even if the game is live on the site

### TermsToQualify

This can be edited on `Content > PromoDetails > DefaultTermsToQualify`.

1. Update the `Title` for the appropriate label of the content.
2. Place the content on the `Text` field.

#### Examples

## CTAs

The `CTAs` component contains 5 child components, each of the componetns are rendered as buttons in the MPP. depending on our use case we can just pulblish or unpublish what buttons we want to be shown.

<img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-ctas.png" />

Each component has their own set of fields, and some of it has already initial values that can be changed.

Here are the fields that can be updated to configure the CTA. Some fields are only present in some CTA,

1. **Text** - Update the text of the button. often times this does not need to be changed, but in rare occasion that there needs to be a CTA that is not available from the pre-made CTAs we can update the name of the CTA.
2. **button-type** - Indicates the color of the CTA. There are only 2 values for this: `primary` and `light`.
    - **primary** - can be used for single CTA MPP, but if there are multiple CTA, one CTA should have this value to indicate that its importance to the group of CTAs.
    - **light** - used for other CTA along with a *primary* CTA
3. **url** - contains the smartlink or url to be used when a user clicks the CTA.
4. **campaignId** - used for promotions that needs to `Opt In` we can place the value of the `PAT ID` or `EDS ID`.
5. **offer-type** - alongside `campaignId`, it indicated what type of promotion the CTA us being used for, the values can be used here is `promo` and `eds`.

Here are the pre-made CTAs and their fields:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="claimNow" label="Claim Now">
        <img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-claimNow.png" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="playNow" label="Play Now">
        <img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-playNow.png" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="login" label="Login">
        <img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-login.png" />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="optIn" label="Opt In">
        <img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-optIn.png" />
    </TabItem>

        <img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-deposit.png" />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Whitelabel MPP

When the MPP is idicated to be made in Whitelabel, most of the time this is because it should be available through multiple states .

To do this we will create a single MPP under the Whitelabel path and clone the MPP to the other states. Cloning will be done to all published components of the MPP, so no need to clone components that are not published. Here are the specific steps for cloning.

1. Open the `Clone Distribution` panel by right clicking the parent component.

    <img className="mt-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-clone-parent.png" />    

2. Select all the states to clone the MPP and click OK.

    <img className="mt-5" src="/img/builds/mpp-v2/mppv2-clone-panel-parent.png" />        

3. Go through each published subcomponent and when opening the `Clone Distribution` panel we can just click the `Clone All` checkbox as it will select all locations we have set to the parent when we have clones it. Then click OK
