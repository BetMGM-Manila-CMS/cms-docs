# Video Banners

A video banner is a component on the casino homepage of a product, that plays a trailer or teaser for a game.

<img className="my-3" src={sample} alt="Image alt" />

The video banner is updated from time to time to display different teasers in a period of time. To update the video banner see sitecore path below.

:::warning[Updating Video Banner]

Video Banners are updated in real time, if there is still a video banner live on casino home, wait until the existing video banner unpublishing date to be finished until you can update the contents of the video banner.

## Getting Assets

For updating the Video Banner, 2 assets are required, a image, `1200x300 Image` and a `MP4 video`.

These assets are acquired differently compared to other tickets. See steps below on how to get these assets:

1. Go to the parent ticket
2. Open Project Details tab
3. Scroll down to see `Project relationships` section and clikc the link under the `This Resolves` label.
4. This will open a `Request`, and click its `Request Details` tab.
5. Under the `Details` section, it will be under the `CMS description` label.
6. Click both links to open each of the assets.

The image is uploaded to sitecore. See this [guide](./assets-uploading) on how to upload assets to sitecore. While for the video, just copy its URL for now as we don't need to upload it to sitecore.

## Updating The Video Banner

Upon opening the appropriate Video Banner for each state, scroll down to the `GameVideo` section. See table below to update the appropriate fields.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ImageOrVideoUrl | `MP4 video` URL |
| ImageThumbnail  | `1200x300 Image` |
| LaunchURL > Url | [See guide below](#launchurl) |

### LaunchURL

First check if the game is live, if not yet consult your sub-lead as to consult what to do. 

On the Casino home if the game is being shown with a `Exclusive` tag under the `Featured section`. Use the smartlink for exclusive games

```
!!M2.CasinoHome/c/exclusive
```

<img className="my-3" src={exclusive} alt="Image alt" />

If not use the launch url of the game which can be get here in the [Smartlinks guide](./smartlinks#games), or in the smartlinks page of the brand state.

## ODR Video Banner

Another type of video banner is the ODR video banner. Some states have ODR Video Banners which also needs to be updated if mentioned in the `needs` for your ticket.
