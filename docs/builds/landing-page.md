## Hero

In this section, you'll edit all images the Landing Page requires. First, you'll need the image URL.

| Key       | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bg        | asset with **2048x800** size                                                                                    |
| img       | asset with **1080x515** size, or the **PNG image that includes the brand logo, promo image, and promo details** |
| img-alt   | You can use the **H1 & H2** from the Copy                                                                       |
| mobile-bg | asset with **1080x1080** size                                                                                   |
