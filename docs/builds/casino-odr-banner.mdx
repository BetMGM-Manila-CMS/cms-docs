# ODR Banner

<Admonition type="info" title="Sitecore Path">
  Content Editor > Clients > m2.`state`.`label` > Casino > Teasers > Repository
</Admonition>

The ODR banner is usually (but not always) needed for casino builds that include a carousel component. Aside from carousels (and more recently, InstaStories), ODR banners are the only other components that have to be scheduled.

## How to build

<img src="/img/builds/odr-banner/odr-banner-links.png" alt="" className="my-4" />

1. Go to the Sitecore path for your respective state and label.
2. Find the component named `ODRBanner-ImageOnlyTitleEmptySpaceTEMPLATE` and duplicate it. For the name, use "ODRBanner-" followed by your ticket name.
3. Under the Links section, update the four links with the MPP smartlink OR the URL provided with your ticket.
4. In the Background section, update the background image, usually with a file named "ODR Teaser BG Image - 900x450". Make sure "Show background image" is checked.
5. Under Publishing tab, clear Publish and Unpublish fields, and make sure "Never publish" is checked. No need to add a QA filter.

  Make sure TeaserProperties > IsEmbeddedTeaser is **NOT** checked! This is only used for *embedded* ODR banners.
