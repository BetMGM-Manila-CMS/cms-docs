# Pick A Box
Pick A Box is an Engagement tool for players to play and win prizes.

## The Layout
First, we must build the layout for our PAB Engagement tool.

:::info[SiteCore Path]
**Layout:**
Content > Vanilla.Mobile > State/Brand > Promo > Pick A Box
**CSS asset:**
Content > Vanilla.Mobile > State/Brand > Promo > PickaBox > PageAssets

Duplicate any of the Layouts, and rename it like in the existing layouts.
You also need to create it's own CSS asset, just duplicate existing css and rename as such.
