# Requesting Assets

Requesting assets is done if there are discrepancies on the provided assets.

Following reasons may be:

* File size is too large.
* Image has contrast issue.
* Image has misaligned elements.
* Image is required but is not provided.

## Prerequisites

In order to request access please check you need to have access to `CMS Design Concerns` Teams group. If not please request your sub-lead to add you to the group.

## Request Format

Please include the following parts to your message:

* **Leads of Designer** - depending on your ticket it can be Casino or Sports. Tag the respective leads for fast visibility of the designers.
* **Reason of Request** - mention what needs to be done for your request.
* **Images to Modify** - list the filenames of the files you want to be updated.
* **Workfront Link** - include the Workfront link of the ticket, preferrably linking to the updates tab.
* **Box Link** - include the box link of the file where it is stored.
* **Image for Instruction** - this can be optional but can really help for adjustments, so the designers can easily figure out what you want to be adjusted.
