# Core Domain

## Overview

Core domains are pages where players can place bets on a certain sport or league. For example, here is the core domain for the NFL:

<a href="https://sports.nj.betmgm.com/en/sports/football-11/betting/usa-9/nfl-35" target="_blank" title="Visit the NFL core page for NJ in a new tab">
  <img src={nflCoreDomain} alt="" className="my-4" />
</a>

You can find links to the other core pages at the top navigation bar or (if you're on [Sports home](https://sports.nj.betmgm.com/en/sports)) in the A-Z menu on the left sidebar.

When you scroll down the core page, you'll find a disclosure component just before the footer that contains the page copy for that core domain.

<video controls className="my-4">
  <source src={coreDomainCopy} type="video/webm" />
</video>

## Updating the Core Domain

Your task is to update the core domain copy for all [Sports states](#compile-final-urls-for-sports-states) (or just the ones specified in your ticket).

You will receive a Google Doc which contains the URL for the core domain and the updated copy you need to use.

<img src={coreGoogleDoc} alt="" className="my-4" />

If you take a look at the URL, you'll notice certain numbers that come after a sport/country/league. These segments actually map to a Sitecore component as shown in the image below.

<img src={sitecoreURLMapping} alt="" className="my-4" />

Let's say we're working on the NFL core domain, which has the following URL:  
`https://sports.STATE.betmgm.com/en/sports/football-11/betting/usa-9/nfl-35`

Take note of the three segments with numbers after the `/sports/` subdirectory:
- `/football-11` - maps to the <img src={sc11} alt="11" style={{ display: 'inline' }} /> component
- `/usa-9` - maps to the <img src={sc9} alt="9" style={{ display: 'inline' }} /> component
- `/nfl-35` - maps to the <img src={sc35} alt="35" style={{ display: 'inline' }} /> component

**The component that maps to the last segment in the URL is the one you need to update.** In this case, you need to update the <img src={sc35} alt="35" style={{ display: 'inline' }} /> component in all three Sitecore paths.

## Sitecore components

There are three components you need to update:

- **Whitelabel** - the "master template" where all labels can clone from.
- **Nationwide** - a clone copy of the above in the national domain (`m2.betmgm.com`). You may not need to update this once you've updated the Whitelabel component, but you still need to include the Sitecore DL in your [WF comment](#).
- **National** - this is where US labels clone from.

:::note

Since BetMGM ON is not included in the US CMS (`cms-us.prod.env.works`), you also need to update the Whitelabel component in `cms.prod.env.works`.

Copy the direct links to the components you update. You'll include this in your WF comment.

## Updating the copy

:::tip

Before making any updates, keep the old core page open in a tab so you can use it as a quick reference later when checking the links for different states.

:::

Place the updated copy into the corresponding Sitecore fields. Make sure the StayOnline checkbox is **checked**.

| Copy document | Sitecore field |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Page title | MetaTitle |
| Meta Description | MetaDescription |
| `<h1>` | H2Header |
| Body text | Text |

<img src={coreDomainCopy2} alt="" className="my-4" />

### Things to update in the body text

- Convert all other headings into `<h4>` tags, and wrap the inner text inside `<strong>` tags. For example:

  Examples:

  - **\<h2\>How To Read NFL Odds\<h2\>** &rarr; `<h4><strong>How To Read NFL Odds</strong></h4>`
  - **\<h3\>What's the Spread in NFL Betting?\</h3\>** &rarr; `<h4><strong>What's the Spread in NFL Betting?</strong></h4>`

- Check the links one by one. If a link redirects to the [BetMGM geolocator](https://promo.nj.betmgm.com/en/promo/geolocator), you need to convert it into a smartlink by replacing `https://sports.betmgm.com/en` in the URL with `!!M2.Sports`. If it loads properly, keep it as is.

  Examples:

  | Link | Redirects to Geolocator? | Final `href` |
  | :--: | :----------------------: | :----------: |
  | [online sportsbook](https://sports.betmgm.com/en/sports) | Yes | `!!M2.Sports/sports` |
  | [NFL MVP Odds](https://sports.betmgm.com/en/blog/nfl/nfl-mvp-odds-tickets-handle-bm03/) | No | https://sports.betmgm.com/en/blog/nfl/nfl-mvp-odds-tickets-handle-bm03/ |
  | [Live betting](https://sports.betmgm.com/en/sports/live/betting) | Yes | `!!M2.Sports/sports/live/betting` |


### "Why is the core page for X state not updating?"

Some states are not set up properly to clone from WhiteLabel. When that happens, you'll have to manually update the Sitecore component for these states. (Hint: it's usually IL)

To do this:

1. Go to *Content > Vanilla.Mobile > m2.`state`.betmgm.com > MobileSports-v1.0 > SEO > Main*, then look for the corresponding component for the core domain you're updating.
2. If you don't see a yellow box that says "This item is cloned! It cannot be modified!" then it means the component isn't cloned from WhiteLabel. So you have to update it manually.

   <img src={clonedItemWarning} alt="" className="my-4 mx-auto" />

3. Update the Sitecore fields like you did with the Whitelabel component.
4. Save and finalize, wait for a few minutes, then check the final URL for that state to see if the changes have already reflected.

## Compile final URLs for Sports states

Once you're done updating the Sitecore components, you need to list all of the final URLs for the states you've updated. This will be included in your WF comment.

Here's a list of all Sports states:

```
- AZ: https://sports.az.betmgm.com/en/sports
- CO: https://sports.co.betmgm.com/en/sports
- DC: https://sports.dc.betmgm.com/en/sports
