First, compress your files as a ZIP file to upload multiple files to sitecore

Make sure that you are inside the appropriate folder, and click on `Upload files (advanced)` and the top of the [content area](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/users/100/sitecore-experience-platform/the-content-editor.html#:~\:text=contains%20no%20subitems.-,The%20content%20area,-The%20content%20area)

<img className="my-3" src="/img/builds/assets/upload-upload-btn.png" />

It will display a popup where you can drag and drop the compressed folder to the `Choose File` input or click the same button and navigate to the respoective folder.

Remember to check `Unpack ZIP Archives` checkbox so it will be automatically unzipped the folder is uploaded.

<img className="my-3 w-1/2 max-w-md" src="/img/builds/assets/upload-dialog.png" />

Click upload and wait for your document to finish uploading.

Copy the direct link and paste it to your reference for your ticket.

## Shared Assets

If your ticket is a [Shared Leaderboard](#) ticket, there will be assets for the [PAT](#) that will be used for 2 different states but will direct to a single path.

There are additional steps in order to do this.

Select the asset and check its `Is SiteMedia Item` Checkbox

<img className="my-3 max-w-lg" src="/img/builds/assets/asset-shared.png" />

Right click the image on the [Content Tree](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/users/100/sitecore-experience-platform/the-content-editor.html#:~\:text=something%20like%20this%3A-,The%20content%20tree,-One%20of%20the) and select `Insert > Upload SiteMedia (Label) File`.

<img className="my-3 max-w-lg" src="/img/builds/assets/asset-upload-shared.png" />

A popup will open and will allow you to select the `Brand State Domain` for the shared image. Click the OK Button to confirm.

<img className="my-3 max-w-lg" src="/img/builds/assets/shared-select-state.png" />

Another popup will open that allows you to upload the other asset that will be used for the shared state. Click Upload to start uploading.

<img className="my-3 max-w-lg" src="/img/builds/assets/shared-to-upload.png" />

It will display a new item as a child but the parent's direct link can be used for the shared PAT. It will automatically change the asset depending on which state it is being viewed on.
