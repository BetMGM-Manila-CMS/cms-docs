First, compress your files as a ZIP file to upload multiple files to sitecore

Make sure that you are inside the appropriate folder, and click on `Upload files (advanced)` and the top of the [content area](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/users/100/sitecore-experience-platform/the-content-editor.html#:~\:text=contains%20no%20subitems.-,The%20content%20area,-The%20content%20area)

It will display a popup where you can drag and drop the compressed folder to the `Choose File` input or click the same button and navigate to the respoective folder.

Remember to check `Unpack ZIP Archives` checkbox so it will be automatically unzipped the folder is uploaded.

Click upload and wait for your document to finish uploading.

Copy the direct link and paste it to your reference for your ticket.

## Shared Assets

If your ticket is a [Shared Leaderboard](#) ticket, there will be assets for the [PAT](#) that will be used for 2 different states but will direct to a single path.

There are additional steps in order to do this.

Select the asset and check its `Is SiteMedia Item` Checkbox

## Uploading mp4 file for Video Banner

There is a new update in building Video Banner tickets wherein we will not use third-party video hosting in creating these tickets instead we will now upload them in Sitecore.

Here are the steps on how to upload mp4 files in Sitecore.

First, you need to download the mp4 file for the Video Banner you can see this in the `Updates` tab of the Parent ticket. If it's not there you can check the `Project Details` or in the `Document` .

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723184827/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/linkimg_tcpv3v.jpg)

After clicking the link you'll be prompted in an Outlook folder, where you can download the mp4 file for the Video Banner. If the mp4 file is in the `Document` tab it will automatically download the file when the link is clicked.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723185095/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/mp4download_acqj5x.jpg)

After downloading the mp4 file you can upload this into Sitecore by going into this Sitecore Path

<Admonition type="note" title="Sitecore Path">
  Media Library > Videos > US > Casino Video Banner > Folder that starts with the first letter your Ticket
</Admonition>

Unlike the normal way of uploading assets in Sitecore, uploading mp4 files is slightly different.

Start with creating a `Media Folder` and rename it to the title of the Video Banner

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723186099/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step1_n87qhz.jpg)![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723186310/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step1.1_ykb5kl.jpg)

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Create your `Media Folder` in the folder that starts with the first letter of the Video Banner
</Admonition>

After Creating the folder browse through the already-created Video Banners and `Duplicate` the file that has this icon and rename it.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723186755/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/musicnoteicon_d0nwgc.jpg)![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723186573/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step2_ok0nmg.jpg)![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723186575/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step2.1_hbworf.jpg)

Don't forget to move your newly renamed file into its corresponding ticket folder.

Next, go to your mp4 file and click `Attach`.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723187236/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step3_qvypbn.jpg)

After clicking Attach choose the mp4 file you want to upload for the Video Banner.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723187229/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step3.1_nileni.jpg)![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723187232/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/step3.2_sh7ax8.jpg)

After it is done uploading, you can check if it's the correct mp4 just by opening and playing it.

For the `1200x300 Image` you can just upload it the same as any other assets in the folder.

Lastly, copy the Direct Link of the creatives of the Video Banner and comment it on the Workfront since this will be used by all states.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1723187819/updates/video-banner-mp4-upload/comment_wcsl3x.jpg)

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  There will be no need to create multiple creatives for different states for the new Video Banner. To avoid accidentally creating multiple creatives by different states we can use the rule we have for SHARED PAT wherein the NJ task will be the one who will build the creatives or the other states can communicate with them to avoid mix-ups.
