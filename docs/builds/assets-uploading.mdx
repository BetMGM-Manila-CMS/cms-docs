A popup will open and will allow you to select the `Brand State Domain` for the shared image. Click the OK Button to confirm.

<img className="my-3 max-w-lg" src={selectState} />

Another popup will open that allows you to upload the other asset that will be used for the shared state. Click Upload to start uploading.
