Click upload and wait for your document to finish uploading.

Copy the direct link and paste it to your reference for your ticket.

## Shared Assets

If your ticket is a [Shared Leaderboard](#) ticket, there will be assets for the [PAT](#) that will be used for 2 different states but will direct to a single path.

There are additional steps in order to do this.

Select the asset and check its `Is SiteMedia Item` Checkbox
