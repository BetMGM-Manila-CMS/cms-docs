## Teaser

The Teaser section in BAU PATs is replaced by the Promo Hub Tile section in engagement PATs. Place the Promohub Tile image (hint: the one with the text) on the Image field. In the Description field, place an empty \<p>\</p> tag.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1719463139/builds/claw-machine/clawmachine-teaser_ggb9ju.jpg)

## Rewards

This section is where the contents from the [Prize Tool](https://betmgm-cms-docs.netlify.app/docs/builds/documents#prize-tool) document will be placed. Each row will contain a description that contains a message and a CTA to direct the user to either claim or use the reward that has been granted to them.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1719463760/builds/claw-machine/clawmachine-rewards_bx2uvq.jpg)

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Most Engagement tool usually has a Title and Image along with the Description but in the case of Claw Machine, there's no need to add that since it has already been added in the Claw Machine Layout.

1. **Description** - The `Description` column's value will be the value from the `PRIZE DESCRIPTION` column from the `Prize Tool` document, but it should be inserted in the HTML format shown below, just replace the appropriate value to be the same from your `Prize Tool` document.
