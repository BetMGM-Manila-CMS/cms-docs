## Teaser

The Teaser section in BAU PATs is replaced by the Promo Hub Tile section in engagement PATs. Place the Promohub Tile image (hint: the one with the text) on the Image field. In the Description field, place an empty \<p>\</p> tag.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1719463139/builds/claw-machine/clawmachine-teaser_ggb9ju.jpg)

## Rewards

This section is where the contents from the [Prize Tool](https://betmgm-cms-docs.netlify.app/docs/builds/documents#prize-tool) document will be placed. Each row will contain a description that contains a message and a CTA to direct the user to either claim or use the reward that has been granted to them.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfu36fiw/image/upload/v1719463760/builds/claw-machine/clawmachine-rewards_bx2uvq.jpg)

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Most Engagement tool usually has a Title and Image along with the Description but in the case of Claw Machine there's no need to add that since it already added in the Claw Machine Layout.
