# MAI Journey

The MAI journey is a popup that shows to certain visitors of the Sports websites to add engagement for available promotions.

## Creating the Main Components

There are 3 main components to create for this type of build, `NOT-REGISTERED`, `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED` components.

For simplicity, since there are already built components for these, we can just duplicate existing components and rename the duplicated items according to our ticket.

<img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-duplicate.png" />

:::note[Naming]

The best practice for naming each items is to use **Uppercase** only. Use shortened name from your ticket separated by `_`.

:::

## Filter

<div id="condition-template" className="wrap-code">
```html title="filter Template"
(App.Product = "sports" AND NOT User.IsKnown AND NOT Request.AbsolutePath CONTAINS 'mobileportal' AND Cookies.Get('trackerId') IN ${val:{Overlay Content Rest ID}.parameters[trackers]}) OR QueryString.Get('qa') = {Custom Filter}
```

The filter has 2 parts that we need to change the values of: 

</div>

1. **`Overlay Content` Rest ID**

    <br />

    :::note[Overlay Content Location]

    The `Overlay Content` can be located on `NOT-REGISTERED > Overlay Content`

    <img className="mt-5" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-overlay.png" />

    :::

2. **Custom Filter** - The filter naming does not have any specific rule, but for best practice we use the name we used for naming the 3 main components and make it lowercase.

    <br />

    :::tip[Filter Example]

    Ticket Name: PS_934896 RUSH BetMGM Jets B10G200 Instantly

    Filter: jets-b10g200

    <br />    

    :::note

    Prefix each filter with numbers 1 - 3, as we need to use a unique filter for `NOT-REGISTERED`, `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED` components.

    <br />

    For Example:

    <table className="mt-3">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Filter</th>
                <th>Component</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>`jets-b10g200-1`</td>
                <td>`NOT-REGISTERED`</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>`jets-b10g200-2`</td>
                <td>`NOT-DEPOSITED`</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>`jets-b10g200-3`</td>
                <td>`NOT-WAGERED`</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    :::

After having the 2 parts for the filter we can place it on the full filter, refer to the [template](#condition-template) above. 

And lastly go into each  of `NOT-REGISTERED`, `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED` `Content` tab, and place it on the `Condition` field under the `Filter` section.

<img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-filter.png" />

## Steps

1. Get the `Rest ID` value of the `shared-steps` component and place it as the value of the `Text` field. Wrap it on `<p></p>` tags.

    <br/>

    ```html title="Text Field Value"
    <p>${val:{shared-steps Rest ID}.text}</p>
    ```

    <img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-shared-steps-restid.png" />

2. **Setting the popup contents**. There will be 3 popups that will show for the user, each popup shows what step the user had already done. The following fields will contain the contents that these popup show.

    <br/>

    <img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-popups.png" />

    Since most of the times Bet & Get are the type of promotions to be used for MAI journey tickets, the steps are similar with only changes depedending on the values or amounts, and the specific sport in which it is implemented. The fields to update can be seen under the `Parameters` section.

            <tr>

            </tr>

                <td>`Landing Page Smartlink`</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    :::note[Landing Page]

    Landing pages are also built along side MAI Journey tickets, use the smartlink to the landing page for the Terms and Conditions link.

    ### Step 3 Description

    The description will depend if the promotion is based either for a **team** or **league** and an **event** or a **Welcome Offer** type of promo.

    <br/>    

    <table className="whitespace-nowrap">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Team or League</td>
                <td>
                    ```
                    On any {Team or League Name} game
                    ```
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Event or Welcome Offer</td>
                <td>
                    ```
                    On any moneyline
                    ```
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

3. **Connecting contents for `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED`** - Since `Overlay Content` is only under `NOT-REGISTERED`, for the other components to use the same contents, we need to update the `content` component for each.

    Under `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED` there is a `content` component. Open it and under the `Data > Items` field, make sure to use the correct `Overlay Content`. 

    <br/>    

    <img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-push-content.png" />
    

## Tracker IDs

The tracker IDs are group of numbers that is used to display the popups to specific players. The tracker IDs is provided in the `Documents` tab of your Workfront ticket, it is a spreadsheet it may be named as `tracker ID`(but sometimes not, so check the provided spreadsheets).

Sometimes the Tracker IDs spreadsheet file contains the IDs for other state, so make sure to only use the appropriate IDs for your ticket.


<details>
  <summary>Tracker IDs Spreadsheet Example</summary> 
  <img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-tracker-file.png" />
</details>

These values will be placed on the `Overlay Content`. Open its `Content` Tab, and under `Parameters` place the IDs on the `tracker` field.

Place it inside a bracket and enclose every ID on double quotes separated with commas.

<img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-trackers.png" />

## Images

The images is placed inside the `NOT-REGISTERED`, `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED` under the `default` component inside the parent `NOT-REGISTERED` and not to be confused by it. 

<img className="mb-5" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-default.png" />

There is only a single image to use, copy the path of the `750x480` image and place it on the `Data > Image` field on all for `NOT-REGISTERED`, `NOT-DEPOSITED`, and `NOT-WAGERED`.

<img className="" src="/img/builds/mai/mai-image.png" />

## Previewing

To preview your created MAI Journey, go to the sports homepage of the appropriate state and add the filter as a query parameter.

```html title="Preview URL Example"
Step 1: https://sports.nj.betmgm.com/en/sports?qa=jets-b10w200-1
Step 2: https://sports.nj.betmgm.com/en/sports?qa=jets-b10w200-2
Step 3: https://sports.nj.betmgm.com/en/sports?qa=jets-b10w200-3
``` 

Upon checking the website it should show a popup each with different steps accomplished. Take a screenshots of these popups and inlude it on your comment along with the Preview URLs
