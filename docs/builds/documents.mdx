## Types of Documents

### Copy

The copy document holds general texts used across builds. Almost every build component requires content, often sourced from this document.

The Copy folder contains the folders for each state, therefore the file will be on the corresponding state indicated on the ticket, unless there are multiple states indicated in which the file will be found on the `All States` folder

## Downloading the Files

  There are instances that older versions may still be used. Please check if it is mentioned on the `Updates` tab or mentioned by your sub-lead in your ticket assignment.

## Cleaning the Contents

Whenever a copy will be converted to HTML it needs to be *cleaned*, this is because when copying something from a document to a parsing tool like [HTMLTidy](https://htmltidy.net/) there will be some unwanted elements that needs to be remove to ensure that the content will render properly when it is displayed on the website.

Here are the list of characters and symbols that needs to be removed:

### Unwanted Characters

| Name                  | Character |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| narrow no-break space | ` `       |
| zero width space      | `​ `      |
| no-break space        | `&nbsp;`  |

### Unwanted HTML Tags

| Name       | Tags        |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| break line | `<br />`    |
| emphasis   | `<em></em>` |

<Admonition type="note" title="note">
  There are still instances that these html elements still needs to be used, only remove out of place elements.
</Admonition>

### Embedding Links

The copywriting team will often include in the copy some words that needs to have a link embedded on it. Usually encase in parenthesis and highlighted in some color.

For this instances, remove the text enclosed in parenthesis and embed the appropriate link for the phrase or word. This can be done by enclosing the text in an `<a>` tag placing the link on its `href` attribute.

<Admonition type="tip" title="tip">
  Using a parser tool like [HTMLTidy](https://htmltidy.net/), a text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or just Sitecore's integrated editor can help you perform this section much faster.

  Simply higlight the text or phrase and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> and a popup will appear for you to paste the approporiate link.
