# Documents

The documents are accessible within the Documents tab of your Workfront tickets. The 2 document files that we need to get is the `General Copy` or just `Copy` and the `Terms and Conditions` document.

:::info

The documents tab contains 3 folders, `Terms and Conditions`, `Design`, and `Copy` folders. Most of the time we only need to access the Terms and Conditions and Copy Folders.

### Downloading the Files

The subfolders may contain files named `Final` or folders named `Final` or prefixed with `CHR`, this are the versions of the document as changes are requested along the way. To avoid confusion, the general rule is to get the copy that is **uploaded on the latest date**.

:::warning

There are instances that older versions may still be used. Please check if it is mentioned on the `Updates` tab or mentioned by your sub-lead in your ticket assignment.

## Terms and Conditions

The Project Details tab under the Promotion section contains if the Terms and Conditions copy is required in your builds.

Sometimes the Project Details tab under the `Terms & Conditions` section of your ticket contains the Terms and Conditions copy if there is none located in the Documents Tab.

This copy often times needs to be _sanitized_ as it will be converted to be in HTML format to be placed in the CMS. In order to do this see this [guide](./).
