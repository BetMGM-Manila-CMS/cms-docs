# Pick A Box

:::info[Copy and assets needed]

- **Prize Tool** - You'll find this in the Documents section of your ticket's Workfront.
- **Box** - Look for the `PAB Assets` folder in the ticket's creatives.

:::note

The Promotion type dictates the *Box* asset to be used, as indicated by the ticket name. PAB promotions involve selecting a **Box**, **Present**, **Card**, and so forth, each corresponding to a designated asset. 

:::

## Offer

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={offer} />

1. Place an empty `<p></p>` tag for the value of the description.
2. The KeyTermsAndConditions will take the value of the `Short Summary` in your copy document enclosed in `<p></p>`
3. For the Teaser Image place the `Promohub Tiles-800x360` image.
4. Place `"Reveal a mystery prize"` for the TeaserClass.

## BoxSection

In this section is where the contents from the [Prize Tool](./documents#prize-tool) document will be placed. Each row will contain a prize title, an image that is assigned to that specific reward, and a description which contains a message and a CTA to direct the user to either claim or use the reward that has been granted to them.

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={boxSection} />

1. **Title** - Place the the contents from the `PRIZE` column from the `Prize Tool` document in the same order to the BoxSection's `Title` Rows.


2. **Image** - For the images use the `240x240` image where it *doesn't show the prize* ([see note below](#boxImageTip)), and place it on all the rows only if there is only a single image provided, but for multiple different images place it the same order as in the creatives folder order.

    <br />

    :::note[Unopened Prize Image]

    <div id="boxImageTip" />

    The images may vary per promotion, for example for Pick a Box the image to use is the unopened box image, for Pick a Card its the facing down card image, etc.

    ::: 

    :::tip[Note]

    Use the image url by clicking the `Open` link of the image on the Media Library. And copy the link on the URL and paste on the image column of the `BoxSection` table.

    :::

3. **Description** - The `Description` column's value will be the value from the `PRIZE DESCRIPTION` column from the `Prize Tool` document, but it should be inserted in the HTML format shown below, just replace the appropriate value to be the same from your `Prize Tool` document.
    
    <br />

    ```html
    <div class="overlay-header">
    <h1 class="mb-1 mt-0">Congratulations!</h1>
    <h2 class="mb-2 mt-1">You've won: $1000 Online Open Hybrid Tournament Ticket</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">Register in our tournament lobby for the Online Open Hybrid Tournament</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Tickets expire after 90 days. T&amp;C's apply.</p>
    <div class="mt-2">
    <a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn-primary" href="{Reward CTA URL}">{Reward CTA Text}</a>
    </div>
    </div>
    ```
    :::note[CTA]

    See the [CTA guide](./cta) to use the correct CTA for each description.

    :::

## PageLayoutDetails

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={layoutDeets} />

1. Do not change the value for the `Desktop Layout Path`
2. Click the Dropdown and navigate to the  [PAB Layout](./engagements-pab) item that you have created for this PAB PAT 

## Content Section

:::tip[Title Fields]

For the Title Fields for `T & C Header` and `How It Works Title`, the values here doesn't need to be changed.

:::

### T & C Content

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={terms} />

</div>
</div>

</section>
```

### Deposit and Wager Criteria Content

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={criteria} />

Place the HTML content below for this field and replace the correct description from the `Overlay Description` from you copy document.

For the CTA, use the appropriate home link depending if this PAT is for a Casino or Poker promotion ticket.

```html
<h3 class="mb-2 mt-1">If you have not picked yet today, you first must qualify!</h3>
<p class="mb-1">{Overlay Description}</p>
<p><a href="{Poker or Casino Home Smartlink}" class="btn mt-1" style="background-color: {Brand Color Hex}; color:#ffffff;">BACK TO {POKER | CASINO}</a></p>
<style>
    .ptb .spin-result-dialog .overlay-content {
    text-align: center;
    }
</style>
```

:::note

Use the appropriate color for the CTA, see this [guide](./colors) for reference.

:::

### Key T & C Note Text

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={tncNote} />

Place an empty `<p></p>` inside this field

### Post Login Error Page Content

<img className="mt-3 mb-5" src={loginError} />

See HTML below and replace the image with the `Background 955x562 Desktop Image` and the CTA with the appropriate values depending on the promotion.

```html
<div class="ptb ptb-prelogin container-bg">
  <div>
    <img class="box-static-img" alt="prelogin_wheel_only" src="{Background 955x562 Desktop Image}" />
    <br />
    <h4 class="postLoginErrorMessage">#ERROR_MESSAGE#</h4>
  </div>
  <div id="post-login-error" class="overlay-bg hover" style="display: block;">
    <div class="spin-result-dialog">
      <div class="overlay-content">
        <a onclick="DisplayNoneById('post-login-error')">
            <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-size-lg ui-close ui-close-primary theme-ex close-btn"></span>
        </a>
        <div class="overlay-header">
          <h4 class="postLoginErrorMessage">#ERROR_MESSAGE#</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="footer clearfix">
          <a class="btn-l3 btn prominent" href="{Poker or Casino Home Smartlink}">Back To {Poker | Casino}</a>
        </div>
      </div>

  </div>
</div>
```
