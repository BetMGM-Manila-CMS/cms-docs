1. If needed, you can change the Terms And Conditions text however you like.
2. In order to change the TnC of your build you need to get the `Rest ID` of the `terms` under your File and paste it here. Do not forget to add the .Text in the last part since that is where it will grab the value of the Terms and Condition in that Rest ID.
