# Coin Flip

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  Coin Toss and Coin Flip is used interchangeably depending on the promotion, but does not have any differences on the promotion or the mechanics, only on the naming.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info" title="Copy and assets needed">
  * **Prize Tool** - You'll find this in the Documents section of your ticket's Workfront.
  * **Coin Images** - Look for the `Coin Flip/Toss Assets` folder in the ticket's creatives.
</Admonition>

## Teaser

![](/img/builds/pat-eds-coin/coin-teaser.png)

1. **TeaserImage** - Use `Promohub Tiles-800x360` image.
2. **Description** - Place an empty `<p></p>` inside the field.
3. **TeaserClass** - Use the `Promo Teaser Section` value from you copy document.

## Rewards

The Rewards section is where the contents from the [Prize Tool](./documents#prize-tool) document will be placed. Each row will contain a prize title, an image that is assigned to that specific reward, and a description which contains a message and a CTA to direct the user to either claim or use the reward that has been granted to them.

One difference compared to [STW](./pat-eds-stw) and [PAB](./pat-eds-pab) is that the last row for the rewards is assaigned to a `No Prize` prize.

* **Title** - Place the the contents from the `PRIZE` column from the `Prize Tool` document in the same order to the BoxSection's `Title` Rows.
* **Image** - We can use the 3 `500x500` images each prize except for the `No Prize` row.

  For the `500x500` images there are the `Coin 1`, `Coin 2`, and `Reward Coin` images, each for the rewards. But there are instances that there are 4 rewards, in this case it would be fine to reuse any of the earlier mentioned images.

  For the `No Prize` row we will use the `Reward Coin 120x120` image.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Note">
  Use the image url by clicking the \`Open\` link of the image on the Media Library. And copy the link on the URL and paste on the \`Rewards\` table.
</Admonition>

* **Description** - The `Description` column's value will be the value from the `PRIZE DESCRIPTION` column from the `Prize Tool` document, but it should be inserted in the HTML format shown below, just replace the appropriate value to be the same from your `Prize Tool` document.

```html
<div class="overlay-header">
<h1 class="mb-1 mt-0">Congratulations!</h1>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-1">You won a prize in the Road to The Big Game Coin Flip promotion.</h2>
<p class="mb-2">Enjoy 10 Bonus Spins on Bankin' Bacon&trade;.</p>
<p class="mb-2">T&amp;Cs apply.</p>
<div class="mt-2">
<a class="btn btn-primary" href="{Reward CTA URL}">{Reward CTA Text}</a>
</div>
</div>
```

For the `No Prize` row the value for the `Description` is provided below:

```html
<h1 class="mb-1 mt-0">Sorry!</h1>
<h2 class="mb-2 mt-1"><strong>You didn&rsquo;t win anything today.</strong></h2>
<p class="mb-1">Come back tomorrow to flip again!</p>
<div class="mt-2"><a rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn-primary" href="!!M2.CasinoHome">Home</a></div>
```

<Admonition type="note" title="CTA">
  See the [CTA guide](./cta) to use the correct CTA for each description.
</Admonition>
