# Rewards

A cashback PAT/EDS is created specifically when a promotion offers a cashback incentive, highlighting the emphasis on the cashback reward.

## PAT

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  It is important to determine the cashback reward from your terms copy because it will be mostly used in the text fields for the cashback PAT.

  For example, here is a list of prizes:

  The last prize on the list is the cashback reward, we also need to take note that this needs to be shortened as the original copy is too long to be used for the text fields of the PAT.

  In this case we can use: `Get 20% Bonus Back on net losses up to $10 Casino Bonus`.

### Basic Promotion Details

## EDS

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The emphasis for EDS will be on its specific reward, which can be determined by reviewing the reward codes supplied by the Ops team in the Engagement PAT.

  For example the EDS reward for a promotion is:

  The reward text, intended for the EDS, can be utilized in the text fields, and it may also be divided into two distinct parts.

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Wagering Instruction</th>
        <td>Wager $5 or more on Casino Games.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Reward to be received</th>
        <td>Get a $2 Casino Bonus on Shamrock Money Pot 10K Ways.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
