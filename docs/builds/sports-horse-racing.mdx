## Updating the Carousel

<Admonition type="info" title="SiteCore Path">
  [Content Editor > Vanilla.Mobile > m2.horseracing.betmgm.com > Horseracing > Teasers > TeaserItems > HomeF > upcoming](https://cms-us.prod.env.works/sitecore/shell/Applications/Content%20Manager/default.aspx?fo=%7BB9587560-37A9-46E1-8FF5-E5D3EE8096E1%7D&la)

There are 9 slots for the Horse Racing Carousel, `upcoming` up to `upcoming9`.

Depending if there are still any active Carousel, find the oldest carousel published by checking the publishing dates in the carousel components.

<Admonition type="warning" title="warning">
 :warning <strong>Do not update carousels that are live or will go live. Only update the carousels which have ended.</strong>
</Admonition>

Update the Carousel by editing the `Background Image` and `DesktopImage` respectively.

Also in the image are the dates for the Carousel.

When publishing, put on the starting date a day before, i.e. Oct. 29, then put 28.10.2024, and as usual add a day after on the end date.

Then repeat the process on the other carousels until up to date.

Re-schedule the remaining, if any, when the previous active carousels have ended.
