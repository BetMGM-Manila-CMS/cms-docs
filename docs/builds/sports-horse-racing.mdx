There are 9 slots for the Horse Racing Carousel, upcoming upto upcoming9.

Depending if there are still any active Carousel, find the oldest carousel published by checking the publishing dates in the carousel components.

Update the Carousel by editing the `Background Image` and `DesktopImage` respectively.

<img src={creative} alt="" className="my-4" />

Also in the image are the dates for the Carousel.

When publishing, put on the starting date a day before, i.e. Oct. 29, then put 28.10.2024, and as usual add a day after on the end date.

<img src={publish} alt="" className="my-4" />
