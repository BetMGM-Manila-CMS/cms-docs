There are 9 slots for the Horse Racing Carousel, `upcoming` up to `upcoming9`.

Depending if there are still any active Carousel, find the oldest carousel published by checking the publishing dates in the carousel components.

:::warning
<strong>Do not update carousels that are live or will go live. Only update the carousels which have ended.</strong>
:::

Update the Carousel by editing the `Background Image` and `DesktopImage` respectively.

<img src={creative} alt="" className="my-4" />

Also in the image are the dates for the Carousel.

When publishing, put on the starting date a day before, i.e. Oct. 29, then put 28.10.2024, and as usual add a day after on the end date.

<img src={publish} alt="" className="my-4" />

Then repeat the process on the other carousels until up to date.

Re-schedule the remaining, if any, when the previous active carousels have ended.
