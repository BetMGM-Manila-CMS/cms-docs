<Admonition type="note" title="Cloned SEOBox">
    If the content is cloned, you need to edit the source item which is located on the Whitelabel directory, but if instead of SEOBoxes, it will be contained within a folder named `SEO-Nationwide-BetMGM-Casino`. 
    
    Otherwise, we can just update the item under the appropriate state/brand

The stakeholders should have provided a document where the updated contents is contained
